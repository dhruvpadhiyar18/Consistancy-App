## 🎯 The Philosophy
Most learners fail not because they lack intelligence, but because they lack consistency. This app is built on the belief that **Consistency > Intensity**. By breaking down the massive fields of AI, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering into manageable daily steps, we eliminate burnout and build lasting habits.

## 🚀 Key Features

### ✅ Dual-Task Daily System
Focus is your greatest asset. Every day, you are assigned exactly **two high-impact tasks**. No more, no less. This structured approach prevents cognitive overload and keeps your momentum steady.

### 🧠 Active Learning (Daily MCQ)
Learning is incomplete without testing. After completing your daily tasks, you must pass a **2–3 question MCQ quiz** based strictly on that day's topics. Only then can you finalize your day and grow your streak.

### 📜 Progress Review Quiz
Every **7 completed days**, the app triggers a **Progress Review**. This isn't based on the calendar weekend—it's based on *your* journey. It ensures you retain what you learned in the previous 7 steps before moving forward.

### 🕒 Journey Log & History
Relive your growth. The Journey Log allows you to revisit any past day to see your completed tasks, learning resources, and personal reflections. Past days are **read-only**, protecting your history of discipline.

### 🏆 Gamification & Motivation
*   **Streak Tracking:** Watch your daily commitment turn into a burning fire.
*   **Trophy Milestones:** Earn visual trophies at Day 7, 30, 90, and 180.
*   **Celebrations:** High-quality Konfetti animations and haptic feedback celebrate your milestones.
